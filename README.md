A brief overview of NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib.pyplot:

1.NumPy:
NumPy is a fundamental package for numerical computing in Python.
It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a wide range of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

Commonly Used functions:

Creating Arrays

Array Operations

Array Manipulation

2.pandas:
pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis. 
It provides data structures like Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) to efficiently work with structured data.

Commonly used Functions:

Creating DataFrames

Data Exploration

Data Filtering

3.matplotlib.pyplot:
matplotlib is a widely used library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. 
The pyplot module provides a MATLAB-like interface for plotting.

Commonly Used Functions:

Line Plot

Scatter Plot

Bar Plot

These examples only scratch the surface of what these libraries can do. NumPy, pandas, and matplotlib are essential tools for data manipulation, analysis 
and visualization in Python,
making them invaluable for tasks ranging from simple data processing to complex data science and machine learning projects.
